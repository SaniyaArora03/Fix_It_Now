# FixItNow 🛠️  
A role-based MERN application that connects customers with nearby service technicians.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

FixItNow is a real-life problem-solving platform where:

- **Customers** can request home services (electrician, plumber, AC repair) using live location.
- **Technicians** receive assigned jobs, respond to them, and update job status.
- The system uses **JWT authentication**, **role-based access**, and **MongoDB** for persistence.

This repository currently contains the **core end-to-end workflow**:
Customer → Job Creation → Technician Assignment → Technician Action.
